> A brief description of a regular occurrence of "propinquity"
As an AI language model, I do not have personal experiences. However, "propinquity" refers to the closeness in proximityor distance between individuals, objects, or events. A regular occurrence of propinquity could be two colleagues who
work in the same office every day, or neighbors who live next to each other and often run into each other while taking
out the trash or walking their dogs.

Propinquity refers to the tendency for things to be close together or nearby,
whether in terms of physical space or time, or in terms of relationship or
kinship. It can also refer to similarity or likeness in nature or character, as
well as the quality of being adjacent or neighboring. In essence, propinquity
encompasses the concept of proximity and nearness, both in a physical and
figurative sense. It is a term that is often used in social sciences and can be
applied to various fields, such as geography, psychology, and sociology, to name a
few.
